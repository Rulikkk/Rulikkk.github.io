This is a todo list, that I use to build this site. Eventually, all the items should be done.

Really important things:

1. Migrate content (and remove test content);
2. Publish;

Let me keep a to-do list right here:

-   [ ] Add CSS for tables (tables look awful right now);
-   [x] Setup deployment;
-   [x] Add dates to posts and improve homepage;
-   [x] Test as PWA;
-   [x] Add PWA icon (maybe other icons);
-   [ ] Add search;
-   [x] Add link to go home;
-   [ ] Add link to rss, using `<GoRss>` icon
-   [ ] Test offline mode on iOS
-   [ ] Add awesome PowerBI as a page
-   [ ] Add About page and link
-   [x] Add some homepage design
-   [ ] Add posts preview
-   [ ] Add sliding from bottom menu
-   [ ] Add comments
-   [ ] Integrate with [react-headroom](https://kyleamathews.github.io/react-headroom/)
-   [ ] Switch to mdx

## Simplification effort

-   [ ] Remove folder per component, store each component in its own folder
-   [ ] All data should go through GraphQL
-   [ ] Move templates to components (they aren't anything more than a component)
-   [ ] Move layout to component.

## Layout structure

-   Layout: used in every page of site, directly. See `/pages`.
-   Pages: these are top-level site pages.
-   Templates: these should be moved to `/components`.
