This is a list of links, that I plan to show to this or that person from my work. I keep it here, in order to tell them to just open my blog and look for the link. _Some links here are in russian._

# How to Work and Motivation

**[Делать и сделать](https://ksoftware.livejournal.com/202173.html), [alt source](https://bureau.ru/bb/soviet/20160121/).** Article describes what is definition of done in general. Article's motto:

> "Done" does not mean "I was doing it".<br>
> "Done" means result of Your work is explicitly accepted [by the client].

<hr>

**[Максимы](https://moreynis.ru/maxim/), Аркадий Морейнис, 1995 год, журнал КомпьютерПресс.** Article describes difference between "industrial programming" and "hobby programming", and which consequences does it have. Article's motto:

> Programming in general is different from professional (industrial) programming in the same way how jogging is different from sprinter's 200m run — in the first case, important thing is the process, in the second — the result.

# Git Helpers

**[Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) — A must-read for anyone using git.** It is still possible to use git without this, but reading this book will help and pay back, eventually.

**[Git Explorer](http://gitexplorer.com) — Simple web app to help with most common git commands in terminal.** Does not imply using any UI with git, as I always suggest.
