Since I like listening to music, sometimes, I find radios or streams of music, that claims it's "for development". I like listening to those, too, so I keep a collecion.

> **PR Request**: In case someone wants to turn this page into a working radio, that allows switching between all of items below, feel free to send a PR.

[FreeCodeCamp Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAKtNV8KcWg) — an endless Youtube stream of "jazzy beats" for coding.

[CodingRadio](https://codingradio.xyz) — Playlists for coding, named like "Focus on Deadline", "Debugging Battles", etc.

[musicForProgramming](https://musicforprogramming.net) — One to two hour long sets of tracks for programming. List is being updated. Cool design.

[Anjunadeep](https://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep) — cool electronic music. Not specifically named to be "programming radio", but sounds really good. This blog is partially done while listening to this.

[Zavtratunes](https://zavtracast.ru/tunes) — sets of cool electronic music. This one also does not name itself "music for programming", but I think it fits.

[Brain.fm](https://brain.fm) — Paid music service: "We use our patented AI music engine and scientific research to create music to help you improve the activities you already do in 15 minutes or less."

_List in progress: I am adding items from time to time._
