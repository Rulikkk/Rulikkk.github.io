Since I like listening to music, sometimes, I find radios or streams of music, that claims it's "for development". I like listening to those, too, so I keep a collecion.

[FreeCodeCamp Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAKtNV8KcWg) — an endless Youtube stream of "jazzy beats" for coding.

[CodingRadio](https://codingradio.xyz) — Playlists for coding, named like "Focus on Deadline", "Debugging Battles", etc.

[musicForProgramming](https://musicforprogramming.net) — One to two hour long sets of tracks for programming. List is being updated. Cool design.

[Anjunadeep](https://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep) — cool electronic music. Not specifically named to be "programming radio", but sounds really good. This blog is partially done while listening to this.

[Zavtratunes](https://zavtracast.ru/tunes) — sets of cool electronic music. This one also does not name itself "music for programming", but I think it fits.

[Brain.fm](https://brain.fm) — Paid music service: "We use our patented AI music engine and scientific research to create music to help you improve the activities you already do in 15 minutes or less."

[Listen to the Cloud](http://listentothe.cloud) — Ambient music mixed with flight radio.

[Poolside FM](https://poolside.fm) — Poolside FM was conceived one awfully rainy summer in the Highlands of Scotland - a virtual vacation, if you will. The audio and video streams are curated to inject a healthy dose of serotonin into your brain.

[Endel](https://play.endel.io) — Endel is a technology that creates personalized soundscapes to reduce stress, increase focus, and improve sleep. It is supported by neuroscience. Completely aligned with the circadian rhythm, the sounds are generated in real-time basing on various inputs such as your location, time zone, weather, and heart rate.

[Coding / Hacking / Felling like a 80's sci-fi superhero](https://open.spotify.com/user/dewanderer/playlist/601WLbJ3Vj91XIugGUJNUe?si=nGWvm759SGCIVir6vY5Kug) — Spotify playlist with retro-wave / lo-fi sounds collection. If you like Kavinsky — Nightcall, you will like this, too!

**PR Request**: Want to add your link or to turn this page into a working radio? [Feel free to send a PR](https://github.com/Rulikkk/Rulikkk.github.io/blob/master/content/2018-12-17%20Coding%20Music%20Radios%20List/index.md).

_List in progress: I am adding items from time to time._
